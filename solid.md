`SOLID` - principles

`Single responsibility principle` - one class does one thing

`Open Closed Principle` - an interface should be open for extending but closed for modification

`Liskov Substitution Principle` - an inheriting class should run separate from the parent without changing parent behaviour

`Interface Segregation Policy` - Interfaces should only be implementing if used, a class shouldn't depend on methods in an interface that it won't use

`Dependency Inversion` - Abstractions shouldn't depend on details and details should be implementations of an abstraction

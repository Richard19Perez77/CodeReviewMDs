`SOLID` - principles

`Single responsibility principle` - ne class does one thing, instead of doing too much work in a single method, separate into a new class for different or next step of work.

`Open Closed Principle` - An interface should be open for extending but closed for modification. Should be able to abstract out the work and implement different use cases not a single interface with multiple use cases within it, constantly extending or adding work to the single interface, class or module.

`Liskov Substitution Principle` - an inheriting class should run separate from the parent without changing parent behaviour

`Interface Segregation Policy` - Interfaces should only be implementing if used, a class shouldn't depend on methods in an interface that it won't use

`Dependency Inversion` - Abstractions shouldn't depend on details and details should be implementations of an abstraction
